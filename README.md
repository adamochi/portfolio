            My earliest memory of playing with desktop computers was in 1992.
            During my lunch break in year one I discovered a dedicated computer
            room at school. There I found a game on a 5 1/2 inch floppy called
            'Moon Buggy', and with a quick tip from a friend I was able to boot
            it up and play this awesome discovery.
